### Hi there üëã 

I'm an graduate student at UCLA üêª, specializing in real-world systems for ML and LLM agents (with [compound AI systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/)).
Previously, I worked at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Microsoft Research Asia.
